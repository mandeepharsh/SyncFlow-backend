<h1>SYNCFLOW</h1>
<hr><p>Designing a comprehensive inventory and equipment management system for large-scale manufacturing environments that commonly involve welding or machining operations. The web application will facilitate logging received materials, assigning these materials to specific locations in the yard or factory, and tracking their issuance throughout the manufacturing process.</p><h2>General Information</h2>
<hr><ul>
<li>SyncFlow is a web-based inventory and equipment management system designed for large-scale manufacturing environments. The system simplifies inventory tracking, location assignment, and material issuance. Built with React.js, Node.js, and MySQL, SyncFlow aims to streamline operations, reduce material loss, and enhance productivity in manufacturing setups.</li>

</ul><h2>Features that can be added</h2>
<hr><ul>
<li>User Access Control: Enhanced user role management and access control functionalities could ensure that users can only access data and functions relevant to their role, thereby increasing security and efficiency.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Integration with Other Systems: The current version of SyncFlow works as a standalone system. Integrating it with other systems like ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) or supply chain management systems could provide a more unified solution.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>FID Integration: One significant enhancement could be the integration of RFID technology. This would allow for real-time location tracking of small materials kept on shelves or in containers, thus further streamlining the tracking process.</li>
